# multiply-ui

A Jupyter-based UI for the [Multiply](https://github.com/multiply-org) project based on
[Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io) and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org).

# Concept

The Multiply images include Jupyter Lab, a dedicated Multiply REST server
and a Multiply Notebook API. 

When the Docker is started on its host VM, the Jupyter Lab server and the Multiply
REST server are started. User get a dedicated URL that brings up the Jupyter Lab
in their browser. From Jupyter Lab they have access to
* Jupyter Notebooks that can import the Multiply Notebook API
* Terminal windows that allow accessing the container environment and 
  mounted file systems. 

The Multiply Notebook API provides a simple set of functions (API) that 
bring up dedicated UI forms, such as data query and job execution.

The API provides access to objects that are a result of the GUI interaction.
Users can further interact with such objects e.g. `job = Job(13); job.cancel()`. 
These objects also have dedicated HTML representations in the notebook. For example
a query result may render a table of data files, or a processing result 
may render quicklooks. 

Another set of functions may be provided for simple analysis and visualisation of the 
processing results. 

For new users, we will provide a set of Notebooks for the most common 
Multiply use cases. Users can use them as starting points.


## Advantages of using Jupyter Lab

* With Jupyter Lab, users can 
  * create and modify any number of wokflows and data anlyses and store them
    in their workspaces;
  * have numerous notebooks and output displays side by side;
  * use a variability of data visualisations already available.
* Very flexible, users can bring up UIs anywhere in the flow and interact with
  the objects they produce such as jobs, queries.
* Python programmers can easily extend the UI capabilities by writing 
  new UI, analysis and visualisation functions.
* Custom widgets can be implemented using JavaScript. 
  This allows for integration of popular and powerful JS visualisation libraries 
  (e.g. Leaflet Map, D3)
* In the Notebooks, users can exploit the power of numerous popular Python data science 
  packages (xarray, numpy, scipy, pandas, ...)
